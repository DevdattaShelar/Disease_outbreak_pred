## End to end Machine Learning Project

### Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end machine learning project that focuses on training models for various health-related datasets, including diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease.

### Components
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: The project contains several Jupyter notebooks for training models on different datasets:
  - `diabetes.ipynb`: Model training for diabetes prediction.
  - `heart.ipynb`: Model training for heart disease prediction.
  - `parkinsons.ipynb`: Model training for Parkinson's disease prediction.

### File Structure
The project has the following directory structure:
```
.
├── dataset/
│   ├── diabetes.csv
│   ├── heart.csv
│   └── parkinsons.csv
├── Sav_Model/
│   ├── db_dataset.sav
│   ├── ht_dataset.sav
│   └── pk_dataset.sav
├── src/
│   └── __init__.py
├── training model/
│   ├── diabites1.ipynb
│   ├── heart.ipynb
│   └── parkinsons.ipynb
├── README.md
├── requirement.txt
└── setup.py
```

### Installation Instructions
To set up the project, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can find the required packages in the `requirement.txt` file. Use the following command to install them:
```
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

### Usage Instructions
To run the Jupyter notebooks, navigate to the `training model` directory and open the desired notebook using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
